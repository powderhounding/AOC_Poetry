# Trees Are Like Fences
what can you do if you can't see the top,<br>
leafy hands waving, twigs and the lot,

the sky hangs blue, blue like water,<br>
the sun shining down, the air getting hotter,

leaves turning brown, not green any more,<br>
birds flying above, clouds creeping ashore,

build and they build, all black, grey, and white,<br>
billowing, breaking, showing their might,

drops falling down, gather in puddles,<br>
tree roots drinking, all muddles and fuddles,

leaves feel the life, through the roots then the trunk,<br>
filling their veins, like your nose from a skunk,

not stinky like that, but fresh and quite clean,<br>
the leaves turn from brown, straight into green,

how high does it stand, can you see the tree top,<br>
unless you're quite tall, I'm guessing knot.

all important it's not, the top green and leafy,<br>
what matters the most, are the roots deep and beefy.
