# Trees Are Like Fences
What can you do if you can't see the top, 
leafy hands waving, twigs and the lot;`

`The sky hangs blue, blue like the water,
the sun shining down, the air getting hotter;`

`leaves turning brown, not green any more,
birds flying above, clouds creeping ashore;`

`build and they build, all black, grey, and white,
billowing, breaking, showing their might,`

`drops falling down, gather in puddles, 
tree roots drinking, all muddles and fuddles,`

`leaves feel the life, through the roots then the trunk,
filling their veins, like your nose from a skunk,`

`not stinky like that, but fresh and quite clean,
the leaves turn from brown, straight into green,`

`how high does it stand, can you see the tree top,
unless you're quite tall, I'm guessing knot.`

`all important it's not, the top green and leafy, 
what matters the most, are the roots deep and beefy.`
