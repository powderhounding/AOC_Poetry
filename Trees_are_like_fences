--Trees are like fences --

What can you do if you can't see the top, 
the leafy hands waving, twigs and the lot,

The sky hangs blue, blue like the water,
the sun shining down, the trees getting hotter,

the leaves turning brown, not green any more,
birds flying round, clouds creeping ashore,

build and they build, all black, grey, and white,
billowing, breaking, showing their might,

drops falling down, gathering in puddles, 
tree roots drinking up, all muddles and fuddles,

the leaves feel the life, through the roots then the trunk,
filling their veins, like your nose from a skunk,

not stinky like that, but fresh and quite clean,
the leaves turn from brown, straight into green, 

how high does it stand, can you see the tree top,
unless you're quite tall, I'm guessing knot.

all important it's not, the top green and leafy, 
what matters the most, are the roots deep and beefy.
